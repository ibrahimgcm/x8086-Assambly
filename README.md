# CEN 214 Microprocessors Lab Classroom

As you already know, course contents are available [here.](https://aa.bbs.tr/lab/cen214-microprocessors/)

This assignment will be your midterm grade, which will affect your overall grade by 20 percent.

In the ***codes*** folder, solutions to the first four weeks' assignments are stored.

**You are responsible for running these codes in the emulator and taking screenshots of your entire screen, like in the example below**

If you can show those screenshots in a single Readme file under the screenshot folder, that would be better, but this is optional (no extra point will be given, just for me to evaluate quickly).

A sample screenshot is given below (3-1).

- Save your screenshots in the screenshot folder for each question.

- Beware of the deadline; after the deadline, there won't be any updates available in your repo.

Note: It is your responsibility to learn Git and Github.
